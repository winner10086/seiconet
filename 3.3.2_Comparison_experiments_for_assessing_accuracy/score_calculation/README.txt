This folder contains two code files for score prediction. 'score tallying num_blue. py' is the code file for processing experimental images annotated in blue, and 'score tallying num_green. 
py' is the code file for processing experimental images annotated in green
In these two score prediction files, simply replacing the image paths at "original_folder_path" and "annotated_folder_path" with the absolute paths of the corresponding files in the 
"Annotated images" file can be directly calculated
