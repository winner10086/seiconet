This repository contains three folders corresponding to the relevant chapters in the paper, namely "2.6._Example," "3.3.2_Comparison_experiments_for_assessing_accuracy," and "Symbolic_Images".
Each folder encompasses the experimental code and the necessary data for the respective sections in the paper.Among them, the "Symbolic_Images" folder serves as a tool for symbolic execution of convolutional neural networks. Details on its specific usage can be found in the folder related to symbolic execution of convolutional neural networks.
The specific functionalities of each folder and the execution processes of the code files contained within are outlined in the ".txt" documents within their respective folders.
